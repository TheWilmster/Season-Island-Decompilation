Spring: Now, my prince, how's the tea?
Spike: Incredibly hot haha...
Spring: [emote,2]You and your tea have something in common then~
Spike: (Was that flirting? That was flirting, right? What do I say??)
-> Comment on the aroma
    Spike: Heh, yeah. Me and tea are totally the same!
    Spring: Is that so?
    Spike: We're smooth n' soothing, but bitter if you don't shower us in sweets.
    <<springDateFillMeter(5)>>
    Spring: [spring_anime,1][emote,1]My! I never thought of it that way, Spike~
-> Play dumb
    Spike: Oh! T- [delay,100][camshake]Thanks! I love it boiling, scorching even.
    <<springDateFillMeter(-10)>>
    Spring: [emote,0][spring_anime,3](Well, it appears that flew over his beautiful head.)
-> I know I'm hot!
    Spike: Heh, glad ye noticed!
    Spike: I'm a totally handsome lad when I wanna be.
    Spring: Why, "handsome" isn't quite it.
    <<springDateFillMeter(15)>>
    Spring: You're [delay,100][camshake][emote,3]"absolutely smashin", my guy~
    Spike: W- [camshake]woah! Where'd you learn that from?!
    Spring: [emote,2][spring_anime,0]It's written all over your face, handsome~
    Spike: [camshake]Woah!!
Spring: [emote,0][spring_anime_stop]So, you've been wondering around here for quite some time now.
Spring: But I've never asked...well...about [delay,200][emote,1][spring_anime,1]you.
Spring: Tell me...what do you do, err, when you aren't visiting my glorious kingdom?
Spike: (What do I do?! I dunno, what do YOU do, pal?)
-> Play video games
    Spike: I guide a powerful warrior through dangerous plains.
    Spring: [emote,1]Oh my!~
    Spike: My job is to command it to slay deadly beasts.
    Spike: Every action is meticulously calculated!
    Spike: But ever so often, I seek wisdom from the ancient masters, for I am not one.
    Spring: [emote,1]You sound very, very talented at what you do, my prince...
    Spike: I'm not too bad at it myself, heh.
    <<springDateFillMeter(-15)>>
    Spring: [emote,4][music_pitch,.8][spring_anime,2]Psh, videogames. I do not vouch for those who partake in this form of entertainment.
    Spring: [emote,0]Spike, how about you touch some grass?
    Spike: Yeah I...uh...
    Spring: [emote,1]You will? Thank you!
    Spike: I mean[continue]
    Spring: [spring_anime,1]You will touch grass. With me. We will touch grass together, romantically.
-> Rockin'
    Spike: I am a master at the electric guitar. It's my ultimate weapon.
    Spike: And I sing songs about some knight in shining armor, rising from the ice, all mighty-like.
    Spike: Wielding a huge axe n' stuff.
    Spike: Me and my crew may not be famous yet, but one of those days...
    Spike: [camshake]DISTORTION SPIKE YEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
    <<springDateFillMeter(30)>>
    Spring: [emote,2][spring_anime,1]So you must be some sort of bard, correct?
    Spike: Yeah, well, a REALLY good bard!!
    Spring: [emote,1]I am not the best at musical instruments, see, but my singing voice makes up for it!
    <<musicPitch(1.02)>>

-> Sleep all day
    Spike: I often visit a strange non-material world composed of thoughts.
    Spike: It's a dangerous world where anything can manifest into existence.
    Spike: My adventures are kept documented in what's called a-
    Spring: [emote,1]A dream journal!
    Spike: Yeah I- well- it's really cool trust me!
    <<springDateFillMeter(10)>>
    Spring: [emote,2][spring_anime,1]I bet you look cute when you sleep!~
    Spike: *gulp!*

<<springAnimeStop()>>
<<emote(0)>>
Spike: [emote,0][music_pitch,1]What about you? I mean- what do you do here?
Spike: Takin' care of a kingdom sounds like a chore!
Spring: [emote,1]Ah, nothing I can't get used to!
Spring: [emote,0]It's like taking care of a garden, really.
Spring: [emote,4][spring_anime,2]A garden infested with [c_yellow]little moles[/c], that's for certain.
Spring: [emote,0]It just...it's gotten [c_yellow]a little difficult[/c], I must admit.
Spring: [emote,1]But...what can I do? I'm a guardian! It's...[c_yellow]my responsibility[/c]. I cannot escape it, haha.
Spike: (The way that text flashed...Do you think we should be askin some questions?)
-> Difficult?
    Spike: Whatcha mean by "difficult"?
    Spring: [emote,1]Ah, well, you see...
    Spring: [emote,0]It used to be...well...I used to work with my sister...
    Spring: But then, [c_yellow]something[/c] happened and...
    Spring: [emote,0]Do you think she hates me?
    -> Yes
        <<springDateFillMeter(10)>>
        Spike: Absolutely.
        Spring: [emote,7]Heh, well I hate her TOO! What a loser! Sticking to screens all the time!

    -> No
        Spike: That's nonsense!
        Spring: ...
        Spring: You're right, you're right...
        Spring: "Hate" isn't quite it.
        Spring: [emote,5][shake]She must...utterly despise my very...existence...*sob*...
        Spike: Hey hey now! I'm sure that's not it! C'mon!
        Spring: But...how can you be so sure?

-> Moles?
    Spike: Moles? Huh? Haven't seen any!
    Spring: [emote,4]Oh, you will see them, alright.
    Spring: They're abundant in...that one...place...
    Spring: [emote,1][spring_anime,4]B- but you don't need to worry about that!
    Spring: All they do is eat dark crystals and be annoying!
    Spring: [emote,5]That...that kind of dark crystal...the one that makes me dizzy...
    Spring: [emote,7][spring_anime,3]The thing that...this little furball asked me for...
    Spring: [emote,0][spring_anime_stop]How did it get here anyway..?
    Spike: Beats me!
    Spring: [emote,1]Beats me!~
-> Responsibility?
    Spike: What were you saying about bein a guardian?
    Spring: [emote,0]See, as a guardian, I must fulfill a purpose.
    Spring: If I don't, then...my kingdom...it collapses.
    Spring: [emote,4]Alas it seems to be...breaking, despite all of my hardwork.
    Spring: [emote,0]Who am I kidding...I've grown lazy...I just...

Spike: That's great! I too uh...partake in uh...
-> Meditating
    Spike: Meditating.
    <<springDateFillMeter(10)>>
    Spring: [emote,0][spring_anime,1]Tell me more...~
    Spike: Well, there's this cabin I often visit, and...
    Spike: I kinda just sit there. Thinkin bout how I ended up in this situation.
    Spring: [emote,7][spring_anime_stop]W- what situation? You're getting me worried..!
    Spike: [camshake]Oh no! [emote,0]It's nothin!
    Spike: It's just...you know.
    Spring: Know what?
    Spike: Siblings!
    Spring: [spring_anime,3]Ah, that I do indeed know.
    Spring: [emote,1][spring_anime,0]You and I aren't so different, are we, Spike?
    Spike: Maybe not!
-> Painting
    Spike: I paint too! But only with pencils. I only draw the sketch under the painting. [delay,200]On sheets of paper.
    Spring: [emote,2]Just say you "draw", silly~
    <<springDateFillMeter(20)>>
    <<emote(1)>>
    Spike: [camshake]Yeah! I draw!
    Spike: Drew myself as a dog, once! Like, a human-dog.
    Spike: It's silly because it's not real, but I like drawin that human-dog anyway!
    Spring: [emote,7]Whaat? Human-dogs are a thing, you know?
    Spike: Oh- ohhh right, yeah, I forgot. This place is uh, magical.
    Spring: [spring_anime,1][emote,3][camshake]You wanna turn into a human-puppy, Spike?
    Spike: [camshake]DO I?!
    Spring: [spring_anime,3][emote,1]Just kidding...I can't do THAT sort of magic!
    Spike: (Aw, man!)
<<springAnimeStop()>>

Spring: Well, you see, I was wondering if you had any special interests.
Spring: Little things of the daily that fill you with whimsy and joy!~
Spike: Hmm...well I...
-> Little fuzzy animals
    Spike: I like little fuzzy animals! I think they're cute.

-> Girls named "Spring"
    Spike: Girls named, by pure coincidence, "Samantha".
    Spring: [emote,3]You're in [camshake]LUCK, lovely~
    <<springDateFillMeter(10)>>
    Spring: It so happens that my name- [delay,200][spring_anime,0]ALMOST sounds like "Samantha"!~
    Spike: Woah! That's awesome!
    Spring: [emote,2]Impressed yet?
    Spike: Yes! Very!
    Spike: No, not at all.

    Spring: No, but it sounded like a cat.
    Spike: What did?
    Spring: I'm not sure.
    Spike: That was weird.
    Spring: [emote,7]Yeah. I didn't like that.
    Spike: Me neither.
    Spring: Yeah.
    <<springDateFillMeter(15)>>

Spring holds the letter with her two hands.
She reads the beginning slowly.
Her reading speed accelerates as she begins frowning.
Her eyes begin to open wide, now looking closely at the letter, frowning even further.
[emote,7][camshake]Her eyes are completely widened, now reaching the end of the letter.
She finishes reading it and looks at Spike in shock.

Spike: I mean[continue]
Spring: [shake][emote,6][spring_anime_stop]THAT'S SUCH A WEIRD WAY TO SAY "YES"!!
